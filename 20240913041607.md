# Show note titles in Obsidian's file explorer

![[media/titles-in-explorer.png]]

My notes are named using isosecs e.g. `20240913041607.md` so the file explorer tells me nothing about whats in them. How annoying!

To fix this, install and enable the Obsidian community plugin [Front Matter Title](https://github.com/snezhig/obsidian-front-matter-title) then set `Common main template` to `#heading`.
